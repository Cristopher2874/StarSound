## Challenge Preparation

### Objective

**The objective of the app is to promote sharing knowledge with community by music and image content based on the James Webb Telescope mission**

### Challenge selection

We as team InCtrl decided to take a leap on the spacial science and focus on a recurrent problem: how to share the amaizing science to people that is not familiarized with?

We decided to take the challenge of the "Symphony of the stars" because we think that music and images are tha main stimulators of today's society, so we decided to use a presentation 
that is familiar with the user.

The idea started by giving the user complete control of the content generation, so the children could play with sounds by hours and the creativity and advanced logic from the
grown-up public could be also stimulated.

So here the idea born. StarSound, an app similar to the infinite scrolling apps that are present in social media, but now, with images and sounds generated using James Webb Telescope
data.

### Concept of the project

The main idea of the StarSound App is to have a friendly interface that allows the user to select a JWT image, then, the App will place buttons on the zones where the image
contains more light, making reference to galaxies, bodies and planets presents in the image. Once the buttons are set, the user can touch the screen and the buttons pressed will
reproduce a sound, this sound is a note or a chord in an instrument that fits the category of relaxing and atmosferic. This sounds where proposed because is the kind of music
that is generally associated with the space and astronomic bodies. When the user is interacting with the image, ¡the image iself has become a musical instrument! Each button
placed in the stars of gallaxies inside the image is like a key in a keyboard or a string in a guitar. As the button is randomly assigned, the sound could change for one time and the 
next one.

when the user is happy with the sounds that the image produces, it is possible to record a short video showing the pattern and music generated by the user. Then, this video could be
uploaded to the app in order to share the creation with other people in community. As the users add their own work, the possibilities are endless, each image has random sounds and the
user can create a new pattern and music each time the user interacts with the image. 

The main aim of the project is to encourage people to use this technology and by looking at the musical creations of other users around the world, be inspired to create their
own music and share it with the community, and in the process, learn about the JWT mission and main facts.

### Planning steps

- **Data collection**: We will collect data from the James Webb Telescope, mainly, learn about the mission and key details in the official website
- **Image Access**: Download and revise the available resources from the JWT official site to implement the images in the project
- **Project Core**: Use Flutter to create the code of the empty app
- **Image Processing**: Develop Python script to recognize the main highlighted zones of the image
- **JSON mapping**: create a json file to store the coordinates of the places where the image has bright bodies
- **Firebase Implementation**: create a database to storage the images and the json files and retrieve them from the app.
- **Music Stock**: Download and implement the sounds
- **Main Home Screen**: interactive to create an inmersive experience from the beggining (background music)
- **Feed Editor Page**: Display the selected image and using the json file, place the buttons in the correcponding coordinates, play sounds when the user press the button.
- **Information Page**: Develop an specific page to show the key aspects of the JWT mission.
- **Scroll Page**: create an special page that is displayed with all the community videos and addtions that users create.
